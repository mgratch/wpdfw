Build your own completely custom credit card payment forms with Stripe & Gravity Forms!

== Description ==

Accept one-time and recurring subscription payments directly on your WordPress site with [Stripe](https://stripe.com) — no coding (not even shortcoding) required.

_"**My client was getting killed with his prior e-commerce solution**. (triple dipping, high gateway fees from 2 banks, prior site developer charging per reg fees, you name it)…"_

That's just one of the many quotes we get from our customers on why they look to [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to easily and securely process credit cards directly on their site, without having to deal with merchant accounts, PCI-compliance, or PayPal.

### But why is it so hard to find a WordPress plugin that allows you to accept any type of Stripe payment? ###
AND doesn't force you to jump through hurdles or completely limit the ability to collect the additional data you need?

You just want to be able to easily

* collect _any_ type of **custom data** from your customer
* accept one-time and/or *__recurring subscription__ payments
* allow your customer to __enter their own payment amount__
* *display prices and accept payments in __multiple currencies__
* *__save or authorize cards__ instead of charging them right away (great for pre-orders)
* *accept Stripe discount __coupon codes__
* provide custom __payment receipts__
* __create a user or a post__ on your site *only* if a payment was successful
* *allow your customers to log in and __update their billing information or subscription plan__, or
* *__re-use their payment information__ without having to fill in credit card details again (great for one-click upsells)

without *any* coding at all, even "short"coding.

You've gone through **all of the Stripe plugins you can find** and they all **seem to be missing one thing** you really need to do.

### What if you didn't have to spend time trying to wrestle a plugin into submission and instead found _exactly_ what you need? ###

_"...Your plugin and Stripe have processed_ **$38,000+** _worth of transactions in the past few months_ **without a hiccup**. _My client is thrilled"_ -David F.

_The plugin is perfect for our requirement of having a multi-functional recurring payment form that gives more dynamism than a more generic payment form would allow. A+_ -Cian O.

How much easier would your life be if you found a plugin that **bends over backwards to help you be successful** with your Stripe payments?

Built by someone that actually knows what they're doing with Stripe, and keeps you and the plugin updated with changes to make sure your payments continue running smoothly without disruption?

_"Naomi has had_ **the most amazing customer support** _while personally helping me through a problem until 3:00 a.m. (her time!) She's_ **knowledgeable about her product working with other plugins and stays current and up to date**_! I almost feel like she's a friend now..."_ - Laurie

> **Gravity Forms + Stripe integrates with _[Gravity Forms](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=208490)_ — one of the best WordPress visual form builders (why reinvent the wheel?) - to allow you to create _completely custom payment forms_ that are processed with Stripe.**

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install and setup the Gravity Forms Stripe Add-On. Be sure to follow *all* of the instructions in order for the Add-On to work properly. If you're unsure on any step, there are [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-stripe/screenshots/).

### Requirements

Requires at least WordPress 3.9, PHP 5.3, _[Gravity Forms](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=208490)_ 1.9, and [Stripe API version](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) 2016-03-07. Works with WordPress Multisite.

### Steps
 
1. Make sure you have your own copy of _[Gravity Forms](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=208490)_. This plugin does not include _[Gravity Forms](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=208490)_. It will work with any of the _[Gravity Forms](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=208490)_ licenses.

2. You'll also need a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account

3. Upload the plugin to your WordPress site. There are three ways to do this:

    * **WordPress dashboard search**

        - In your WordPress dashboard, go to the **Plugins** menu and click the _Add New_ button
        - Search for `Gravity Forms Stripe`
        - Click to install the plugin that says Gravity Forms Stripe by gravity+

    * **WordPress dashboard upload**

        - Download the plugin zip file by clicking the orange download button on this page
        - In your WordPress dashboard, go to the **Plugins** menu and click the _Add New_ button
        - Click the _Upload_ link
        - Click the _Choose File_ button to upload the zip file you just downloaded

    * **FTP upload**

        - Download the plugin zip file by clicking the orange download button on this page
        - Unzip the file you just downloaded
        - FTP in to your site
        - Upload the `gravity-forms-stripe` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

4. Visit the **Plugins** menu in your WordPress dashboard, find `Gravity Forms + Stripe` in your plugin list, and click the _Activate_ link

5. Visit the **Forms->Settings** menu, select the new _Stripe_ tab, and add your Stripe API keys in the _Stripe Account Information_ section. Save your settings.

6. Select the _Settings_ tab and set your desired currency. The default currency for your Stripe account will chosen by default.

7. Create a form, adding at least one product field along with the new _Credit Card_ field that appears under _Pricing Fields_.

8. In the **Form Settings->Stripe menu**, add a new Stripe rule for your form

If you need help, just click the **Stripe Help** button to access the [documentation included in your WordPress dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-stripe/screenshots/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have my own copy of Gravity Forms for this plugin to work? =
Yes, you need to install the [Gravity Forms plugin](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=208490 "visit the Gravity Forms website") for this plugin to work.

= Does this version work with the latest version of Gravity Forms? =
Just look at the version number! This plugin is structured to use the Gravity Forms version number in its own version number. So if the Add-On version number starts with a Gravity Forms major release number like *1.8*, then it will work with *Gravity Forms 1.8* and all of its minor releases — 1.8.1, 1.8.2, etc.

= Does your plugin use Stripe.js? =
Yes.

= Do I need to have SSL? =
Yes, according to the Stripe Terms of Service regarding PCI-compliance. Click the [Stripe Help button in your WordPress dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-stripe/screenshots/) for how to setup SSL on your site.

= I'm having an issue — how do I figure out what's wrong? =
Click the [Stripe Help button in your WordPress dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-stripe/screenshots/) and the detailed troubleshooting section will appear

= Your plugin just does not work =
That's not a question ;-) but I can assure you that is not the case — use the [Stripe Help button in your WordPress dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-stripe/screenshots/) to get help or check out all of the [support options](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-stripe/other_notes/)
